	<t>This document defines an information model  for the I2RS 
	Filter-based Routing Information Base (RIB) Yang model. A routing system uses
	the Filter-based RIBto program FIB entries that process incoming
	packets by matching on multiple fields within the packet and then performing
	a specified action on it.  The FB-RIB can also specify an action to forward 
	the packet according to the FIB entries programmed
	 using the RIBs of its routing instance.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture"></xref> 
	  architecture provides dynamic read and write access to the information and state within the routing
      elements. The I2RS client interacts with the I2RS agent in one or more network routing systems. 
	  </t>
     <t> This document provides an information module for the I2RS filter Based Routing Information Base
	 (FB-RIB) and describes the I2RS interaction with routing filters within a routing element. 
	 </t>
	 <section title="Definition of I2RS Filter Based RIB">
	 <t>Filter-based routing is a technique used to make packet forwarding decisions
     based on a filter that is matched to the incoming packets and the specified action.
	 It should be noted that that this is distinct from the static routes in the RIB
	 <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model"></xref> where the routing is destination 
	 ddress based.  
	 </t>
	<t> A Filter-Based RIB (Routing Information Base) is contained in a routing
	  instance (defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model"></xref>). 
	  It contains a list of filters (match-action conditions), a list of interface the filter-based
      forwarding operates on. Filter-based RIBs (FB-RIBs) operate only on the interface the
       FB-RIB are configured on.
	  </t> 
	<t>A Filter Based RIB uses Event-Condition-Action policy.
	A Filter-based RIB entry specifies matches
	 on fields in a packet (which may include layer 2 fields, IP header fields, transport or 
	 application fields) or size of the packet or interface received on. 
	The matches are contained in an ordered list of filters which 
	contain pairs of match condition-action (aka event-condition-action).
	</t>
	<t>
	If all matches fail, default action is to forward the packet using 
	FIB entries that were programmed by the Routing Informational Base
	(RIB) manager described
	in <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model"></xref>. 
	</t>
	<t>	Actions in the condition-action pair may impact forwarding or 
	set something in the packet that will impact forwarding.
	Policy actions are typically applied before applying QoS constraints
    since policy actions may override QoS constraint.
	 </t>
	<t>
    The Filter-Based RIB resides in ephemeral state as does the I2RS RIB and I2RS
	topology models.
	 </t>
	 </section>
	 <section title="ECA Policy Supported">
	<t> The filter based-RIB uses event-condition-action policy (ECA) rules.
	 The following policies are used in this version of the yang module:
	<list style="symbols"> 
	<t> Access lists (ACLs) <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model"></xref>
	</t> 
 	<t> Basic network filters <xref target="I-D.hares-i2rs-bnp-info-model"></xref>
	</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t> 
	Proprietary filters may augment these IETF defined ECA rules.
	The IETF filters support basic filtering plus QOS and load balancing.
    Below is an example set of match conditions on ingreessI2RS
	that the basic I2RS FB-RIB can support.

		<t> A Filter-Based RIB (FB-RIB)contains an ordered set of filter routes where each
		filter-route is a match condition followed by an action. An FB-RIB is contained in a
		routing-instance that is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model"></xref> 
		and whose data modelling is done in <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-data-model"></xref>. 
		An FB-RIB has a list of interfaces that is a subset of the list of interfaces in the
		routing-instance that it is contained in. An incoming packet on an interface belonging
		to a FB-RIB is first handled by the FIB programmed using that FB-RIB.
		If no match action succeeds, then the packet is forwarded using the FIB programmed using
		the RIB of that routing instance. 
        </t>
		<t>
		An ordered set of filters implies that the insertion of a filter route into a FB-RIB
		MUST provide the ability to insert a filter route at any specific position and 
		delete of a filter-based route at a specific position.  The ability to change a filter route
		at a specific position combines these two functions (delete an existing filter route
		rule and add a new policy rule). </t>
		<t>Each FB-RIB is contained within a routing instance, but 
        one routing instance (named by an INSTANCE_NAME) can contain multiple FB-RIBs.
		Each routing instance is associated with a set of interfaces, a router-id, 
	    and list of FB-RIBs. Each interface
		can be associated with at most one FB RIB. 
		</t> 
		<t> The processing within the FB-RIB process
		within the routing system is expected to do the following:
		<list style="symbols">
		<t> When a packet successfully matches match term/entry in a filter-route, the corresponding
		rule-actions are applied.</t>
		<t>If a packet does not match the match term/entry in the filter route, the filter route processing goes to the next 
		term/entry in the order, and looks for a match, within the current filter or goes to the 
		next filter in the list.  This continues until either a filter route match term/entry is successfully
		matched, or no more filters in the list exists.  </t>
		<t>If no match has been found within list of filters in FB-RIB list, then the packet will be
		forwarded using the I2RS RIB specified by the FB-RIB if one exists.  If no I2RS RIB is specified,
 		the packet will be discarded. </t>
		</list>

      <t>A I2RS RIB is ephemeral data store that will 
 dyanamically change traffic paths set by the routing configuration.
 An I2RS FB-RIB provides dynamic Event-Condition-Action policy that
 will further change the operation of forwarding by allow dyanmic 
 policy and ephemeral RIBs to alter the traffic paths set by 
 routing configuration.  Care must be taken in deployments to
 use the appropriate security and operational control to make 
 use of the tools the I2RS RIB and I2RS FB-RIB provide.
